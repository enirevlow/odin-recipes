      <li>
        Start by creating the cream mixture by combining the water, fish sauce,
        Tabasco sauce, salt, a pinch of black pepper, half & half, milk, and
        flour in big bowl and whisk until incorporated. Set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat a heavy pot over medium heat and pour in the olive oil. Once the
        oil is hot, add all the vegetables and sweat covered, for approximately
        10 minutes. Stir occasionally.
      </li>

      <li>
        Whisk the cream mixture into the vegetables and bring it to a simmer.
        Simmer for approximately 15 minutes while stirring frequently until
        mixture begins to thicken.

      <li>
        Add the shrimp and cook until tender, approx. 5-8 minutes. Stir
        frequently. Season with more salt and pepper to your taste.
